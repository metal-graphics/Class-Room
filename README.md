Class-Room
==========

A 3-dimensional implementation of the Class-Room scenario in OpenGL. Only the quad structure is used and manipulated to create different objects - walls, ceiling , tables, benches and other objects. Simple animation is added to create a rotating fan. 
Interactivity is also implemented. Left and right mouse clicks zooms in and out respectively. The up, down, left and right arrow keys on the keyboard, when clicked pans (translates) the scene in the respective directions.
